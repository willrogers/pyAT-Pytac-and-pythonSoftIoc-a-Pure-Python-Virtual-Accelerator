\begin{abstract}
   Many conference series have adopted the same standards for electronic
   publication and have joined the Joint Accelerator Conferences Website (JACoW)
   collaboration for the publication of their proceedings.
   This document describes the common requirements for the submission of papers
   to these conferences. Please consult individual conference
   information for page limits, method of electronic submission, etc.
   It is not intended that this should be a tutorial in word processing;
   the aim is to explain the particular requirements for electronic publication
   at these conference series.
\end{abstract}


\section{submission of papers}
Each author should submit the PDF file and all of the source files (text and figures),
to enable the paper to be reconstructed if there are processing difficulties.

\section{manuscripts}
Templates are provided for recommended software and authors are
advised to use them. Please consult the individual conference help pages if questions
arise.

\subsection{General Layout}

These instructions are a typical implementation of the
requirements. Manuscripts should have:
\begin{Itemize}
    \item  Either A4 (\SI{21.0}{cm}~$\times$~\SI{29.7}{cm}; \SI{8.27}{in}~$\times$~\SI{11.69}{in}) or US
           letter size (\SI{21.6}{cm}~$\times$~\SI{27.9}{cm}; \SI{8.5}{in}~$\times$~\SI{11.0}{in}) paper.
    \item  \textit{\textbf{Single-spaced}} text in two columns of \SI{82.5}{mm} (\SI{3.25}{in}) with \SI{5.3}{mm}
           (\SI{0.2}{in}) separation. More recent versions of MSWord have a default spacing of 1.5 lines;
           authors must change this to 1 line.
    \item  The text located within the margins specified in Table~\ref{l2ea4-t1}
           to facilitate electronic processing of the PDF file.
\end{Itemize}
\begin{table}[hbt]
   \centering
   \caption{Margin Specifications}
   \begin{tabular}{lcc}
       \toprule
       \textbf{Margin} & \textbf{A4 Paper}                      & \textbf{US Letter Paper} \\
       \midrule
           Top         & \SI{37}{mm} (\SI{1.46}{in})            & \SI{0.75}{in} (\SI{19}{mm})        \\
          Bottom       & \SI{19}{mm} (\SI{0.75}{in})            & \SI{0.75}{in} (\SI{19}{mm})        \\
           Left        & \SI{20}{mm} (\SI{0.79}{in})            & \SI{0.79}{in} (\SI{20}{mm})        \\
           Right       & \SI{20}{mm} (\SI{0.79}{in})            & \SI{1.02}{in} (\SI{26}{mm})        \\
       \bottomrule
   \end{tabular}
   \label{l2ea4-t1}
\end{table}

The layout of the text on the page is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{l2ea4-f1}. Note that the paper's title and the author list should be
the width of the full page. Tables and figures may span the whole \SI{170}{mm} page width,
if desired (see Fig.~\ref{l2ea4-f2}), but if they span both columns, they should be placed at
either the top or bottom of a page to ensure proper flow of the text
(Word templates only: the text should flow from top to bottom in each column).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \centering
   \includegraphics*[width=65mm]{JACpic_mc}
   \caption{Layout of papers.}
   \label{l2ea4-f1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fonts}

In order to produce good Adobe Acrobat PDF files,
authors using a \LaTeX\ template are asked to use only Times (in roman [standard],
bold or italic) and symbols from  the standard set of fonts. In Word use only Symbol
and, depending on your platform, Times or Times New Roman fonts in standard, bold or
italic form.

\begin{figure*}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{JACpic2v3}

    \caption{Example of a full-width figure showing the JACoW Team at their annual
             meeting in 2012. This figure has a multi-line caption that has to
             be justified rather than centered.}
    \label{l2ea4-f2}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Title and Author List}

The title should use \SI{14}{pt} bold uppercase letters and be centered on the page.
Individual letters may be lowercase to avoid misinterpretation (e.g., mW, MW).
To include a funding support statement, put an asterisk after the title and
the support text at the bottom of the first column on page~1---in Word,
use a text box; in \LaTeX, use $\backslash$\texttt{thanks}.

The names of authors, their organizations/affiliations and mailing addresses
should be grouped by affiliation and listed in \SI{12}{pt} upper- and lowercase letters.
The name of the submitting or primary author should be first, followed by
the co-authors, alphabetically by affiliation.


\subsection{Section Headings}

Section headings should not be numbered. They should
use  \SI{12}{pt}  bold  uppercase  letters  and  be  centered  in  the
column. All section headings should appear directly above
the text---there should never be a column break between a heading and the
following paragraph.

\subsection{Subsection Headings}

Subsection  headings  should  not  be  numbered.
They should use \SI{12}{pt} italic letters and be left aligned in the column.
Subsection headings use \emph{T}itle \emph{C}ase (or \emph{I}nitial \emph{C}aps)
and should appear directly above the text---there should never be a column break
between a heading and the following paragraph.

\subsubsection{Third-level Headings} are created with the \LaTeX\ command \verb|\subsubsection|.
In the Word templates authors must bold the text themselves; this
heading should be used sparingly. See Table~\ref{style-tab} for its
style details.

\subsection{Paragraph Text}

Paragraphs should use \SI{10}{pt} font and be justified (touch each side) in
the column. The beginning of each paragraph should be indented
approximately \SI{3}{mm} (\SI{0.13}{in}). The last line of a paragraph should not be
printed by itself at the beginning of a column nor should the first line of
a paragraph be printed by itself at the end of a column.

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Equations}

Place figures and tables as close to their place of mention as
possible. Lettering in figures and tables should be large enough to
reproduce clearly. Use of non-approved fonts in figures can lead to
problems when the files are processed. \LaTeX\ users should be sure to use
non-bitmapped versions of Computer Modern fonts in equations (Type\,1 PostScript
or OpenType fonts are required, Their use is described in the JACoW help
pages~\cite{jacow-help}).

Each figure and table must be numbered in ascending order (1, 2, 3, etc.) throughout
the paper. Figure captions (\SI{10}{pt} font) are placed below figures, and table captions are placed above tables. Single-line captions are centered in the column, while captions that span more than one line should be justified. The \LaTeX\ template uses the ‘booktabs’ package to
format tables.

A simple way to introduce figures into a Word document is to place them inside a table that has no borders. This is done in Word as described below.

\textit{Note: If the figure spans both columns, do all steps. If
the figure is contained in a single column, start at step 5.}

\begin{Enumerate}
\item	Insert a continuous section break.
\item	Insert two empty lines (makes later editing easier).
\item	Insert another continuous section break.
\item	Click between the two section breaks and Page Layout $\rightarrow$
        Columns $\rightarrow$ Single.
\item	Insert $\rightarrow$ Table select a one-column, two-row table.
\item	Paste the figure in the first row of the table and adjust the size as appropriate.
\item	Paste/Type the caption in the second row and apply the appropriate figure caption style.
\item	Table $\rightarrow$ Table properties $\rightarrow$ Borders and
        Shading $\rightarrow$ None.
\item	Table $\rightarrow$ Table properties $\rightarrow$ Alignment $\rightarrow$ Center.
\item	Table $\rightarrow$ Table properties $\rightarrow$ Text wrapping $\rightarrow$ None.
\item	Remove blank lines from in and around the table.
\item	If necessary play with the cell spacing and other parameters to improve appearance.
\end{Enumerate}

If a displayed equation needs a number (i.\,e., it will be referenced), place it flush with the right margin of the column (see Eq.~\ref{eq:units}). The equation itself should be indented (centered, if possible). Units should be written using the roman (standard) font,
not the italic font:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:units}
    C_B=\frac{q^3}{3\epsilon_{0} mc}=\SI{3.54}{\micro eV/T}
\end{equation}

\subsection{References}

All bibliographical and web references should be numbered and listed at the
end of the paper in a section called \SEC{References}. When citing a
reference in the text, place the corresponding reference number in square
brackets~\cite{exampl-ref}. The reference citations in the text should be numbered
in ascending order.

A URL may be included as part of a reference, but
its hyperlink should NOT be added. Multiple citations should appear in
the same square bracket~\cite{jacow-help, exampl-ref2, exampl-ref3} or
with ranges, e.g., \cite{jacow-help}--\cite{exampl-ref3} or \cite{jacow-help, exampl-ref, exampl-ref2, exampl-ref3, exampl-last}.

Examples of correctly formatted references can be found at the JACoW website (http://JACoW.org). Once there, click on the ‘for Authors’ link at the top and then on the ‘Formatting
Citations’ link in the left-hand column \cite{jacow-help}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes on the title and author lines may be used for acknowledgments,
affiliations and e-mail addresses. A non-numeric sequence of characters (*, \#,
\dag, \ddag) should be used.
Word users---DO NOT use Word's footnote feature (\textbf{Insert}, \textbf{Footnote})
to insert footnotes, as this will create formatting problems. Instead, insert
the title or author footnotes manually in a text box at the bottom of the first column with a
line at the top of the text box to separate the footnotes from the rest of
the paper's text.  The easiest way to do this is to copy the text box from
the JACoW template and paste it into your own document.
These “pseudo footnotes” in the text box should only
appear at the bottom of the first column on the first page.

Any other footnote in the body of the paper should use the normal numeric
sequencing and appear as footnote\footnote{This text should appear
in the column where it was referenced.} in the same column where they are used.

\subsection{Acronyms}

Acronyms should be defined the first time they appear.

\section{styles}

Table~\ref{style-tab} summarizes the fonts and spacings used in the styles of
a JACoW template (these are implemented in the \LaTeX\ class file).

\section{page numbers}

\textbf{DO NOT include any page numbers}. They will be added
when the final proceedings are produced.

\section{templates}

Templates and examples can be retrieved through web
browsers such as Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer by saving to disk.

Template documents for the recommended word processing software are
available from the JACoW website (\url{http://JACoW.org}) and exist for
\LaTeX, Microsoft Word (Mac and PC) and OpenOffice for US letter and A4 paper sizes.

Use the correct template for your paper size and version of Word.
Do not transport Microsoft Word documents across platforms, e.g.,
Mac~$\leftrightarrow$~PC. When saving a Word 2010 file (PC), be sure
to click `Embed fonts' in the Save options. Fonts are embedded by default
when printing to PDF on Mac OSX.

Please see the information and help files for authors on the JACoW.org website
for instructions  on  how to install templates in your Microsoft templates folder.

\section{checklist for electronic publication}

\begin{Itemize}
    \item  Use only Times or Times New Roman (standard, bold or italic) and Symbol
           fonts for text---\SI{10}{pt} minimum except references, which can be \SI{9}{pt} or \SI{10}{pt}.
    \item  Figures should use Times or Times New Roman (standard, bold or italic) and
           Symbol fonts when possible---\SI{6}{pt} minimum.
    \item  Check that citations to references appear in sequential order and
           that all references are cited~\cite{exampl-last}.
    \item  Check that the PDF file prints correctly.
    \item  Check that there are no page numbers.
    \item  Check that the margins on the printed version are within \SI{\pm1}{mm}
           of the specifications.
    \item  \LaTeX\ users can check their margins by invoking the
           \texttt{boxit} option.
\end{Itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Any conclusions should be in a separate section directly preceding
the \SEC{Acknowledgment}, \SEC{Appendix}, or \SEC{References} sections, in that
order.

\section{acknowledgment}
Any acknowledgment should be in a separate section directly preceding
the \SEC{References} or \SEC{Appendix} section.
